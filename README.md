👋 Hi! I’m Jordan!

👀 I’m interested in backpacking, TTRPGs, and BSM physics.

🌱 I’m currently learning how packaging works! CMake isn't so scary.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything involving graviton/gravitino research.

📫 I'm on Discord! Drop me a message there (jayashley) or send me an [email](mailto:jashley6@vols.utk.edu).
