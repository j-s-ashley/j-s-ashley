- 👋 Hi! I’m Jordan!
- 👀 I’m interested in backpacking, TTRPGs, and BSM physics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ROOT as part of a project investigating new physics discovery potential in long-lived lepton decay processes!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything involving graviton/gravitino research.
- 📫 I'm on Discord! Drop me a message there (jayashley) or send me an [email](mailto:jashley6@vols.utk.edu).
